mash_screen
==============

Purpose
-------

This component performes mash screen to find plasmids
contained in high throughoput sequencing data, using as inputs read files
(FastQ files). Then, the resulting file can
be imported into `pATLAS <http://www.patlas.site/>`_.
This component searches for containment of a given sequence in read sequencing
data.
However, this process can be user for other purposes, by providing a different
database than the default that is intended for plasmid searches.

.. note::
    - pATLAs documentation can be found `here <https://tiagofilipe12.gitbooks.io/patlas/content/>`_.
    - MASH documentation can be found `here <https://mash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Input/Output type
------------------

- Input type: ``fastq``
- Output type: ``json``


Parameters
----------

- ``noWinner``: A variable that enables the use of -w option for mash screen.
  Default: false.

- ``pValue``: P-value cutoff for the distance estimation between two sequences to
  be included in the output. Default: 0.05.

- ``identity``: The percentage of identity between the reads input and the
  reference sequence. Default: 0.9.

- ``refFile``: "Specifies the reference file to be provided to mash. It can
  either be a fasta or a .msh reference sketch generated by mash.
  Default: '/ngstools/data/patlas.msh'.


Published results
-----------------

- ``results/mashscreen/``: A `JSON` file that can be imported to `pATLAS <http://www.patlas.site/>`_
  with the results from mash screen.


Published reports
-----------------

None.
