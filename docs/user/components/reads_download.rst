reads_download
==============

Purpose
-------

This component downloads reads from the SRA/ENA public databases from a
list of accessions. First, it tries to use `aspera connect`_ to download
reads, if a valid aspera key is provided. Otherwise it uses curl, which is
substantially slower. The reads for each accession are then emitted through
the main output of this component to any other component (or components) that
receive FastQ data.
